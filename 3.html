<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>
  I do a lot of things. This is another thing that I really enjoy being in Argentina.<br>
  For me, the life style in Argentina is totally different from where I was born and raised.<br>
  I am from Seoul, where everything works so fast. In Seoul, you need to think
  fast, act fast, and get the result fast.<br> But in Argentina, it is completely opposite. <br>
</p>
  I work 8 hours from Monday to Friday. I also enjoy cooking. <br>
  I finally understood how to enjoy the slow process of cooking something, and taste my own work.
  <br> I am into the Wire craft art. I make my own earrings and rings.<br>
  I also have new passion, which is now coding, learning HTML, CSS, Java Script, Python.<br>
  I try to take some part of Seoul off, and to learn how to live my life fully.<br>
  I seek for what I like, what I would like to try. And try to enjoy
  every moment. That is what I do.
